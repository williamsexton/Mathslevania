# Mathslevania
# PRODUCTION README

## THE GOAL
![Action Flow](https://meat-project-seed.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Screen+Shot+2020-06-22+at+8.57.33+AM.png)
  To sharpen my understanding Vanilla Javascript, the HTML Canvas and DOM manipulation, I took 3 days in an attempt to build a simple educational videogame with varied backgrounds and enemies, the kind that could have kept one of my students distracted for a good half hour. The game is less a game and more a means of thinly cloaking math problems.
  
## TECHNOLOGIES
  - Javascript
  - HTML5 Canvas
## THE END RESULT
![Screen Capture](https://meat-project-seed.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/newRec.gif)
  My game was nothing groundbreaking, but I completed what I set out to do, and developed my knwolege of basic DOM operations, and I got a lot of people to solve math problems under the guise of beta testing. Wonderful stuff
  
## KEY FEATURES
  - Tutorial
    - The game, while simple is fairly confusing to pick up without context, so there is a tutorial available in the level select which goes over the controls and UI
  - Level Select
    - Diferent environments are populated with questions from diferent subjects
    - Animated backgrounds display their animations in the level select menu
  - User Interface 
    - Animated health bar displays remaining mistakes permitted
    - Math problems and their next steps/solutions are displayed, breaking problem solving down into a simple binary
  - Gameplay
    - The player can 'attack' or 'defend' at any time 
    - There are animations for every situation for the player as well as each monster
    - Attacking confirms the displayed step/solution where defending cycles to a diferent step/solution
    - Attacking a wrong answer will cause the player to take damage

## HOW TO USE
 To get an idea of how to play the game, the player can refer to the tutorial located in the level select menu.
  
## UNDER THE HOOD

  Mathslevania was built entirely out of Vanilla Javascript with no external libraries, this forced me to build every aspect of my game from the ground up, familiarizing myself with 
  
## FUTURE UPDATES
  My main priority would be updating the math questions to use LaTeX stylings, this would dramatically improve the look of the math problems, and the variety of problems that could be included
